IMU Data

Each .mat file in /Data/ includes 2 N*4 matrices, namely acceleration and gyroscope. Variable N represents the number of samples in each session. 
The first column for both the acceleration and gyroscope matrices represents the timestamp in milliseconds. The next three columns represent the acceleration or rotation in the x,y and z axis respectively. 
The accelerometer measures in g units and the gyroscope measures in degrees/second.

Groundtruth

Each .mat file in /GT/ includes a M*4 matrix, named GT. Variable M represents the number of annotation in-meal micro-movements for the specific subject. The second and third columns of each GT matrix represent the start and end points of the micro-movement respectively. The fourth column represents the observed micro-movement. The label to micro-movement mapping is provided below.

1 -> no movement
2 -> upwards
3 -> downwards
4 -> pick food
5 -> mouth
6 -> other movement
